# Multilevel Maze Generator

## Purpose
This module can be used to generate random mazes of many floors in Roblox. Each maze ends in a ramp connecting it to the maze on the next level.

## Usage
The module can be used by requiring Main (Under Main > .main.module.lua). From there, there are two steps:

1. Call the generate function on Main. This will return a Grid object which stores the maze.
2. Call the build method on the Grid. This builds the maze and places it into 3D space.

## Options
There are a variety of options available for the generator. These are documented inside Main & will be added here later.
